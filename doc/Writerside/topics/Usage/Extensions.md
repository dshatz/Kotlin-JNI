# ⚙️ Kotlin JNI Extensions

Some of these extensions can be useful when not using the [KSP generator](CallingNative.md) and writing your own `@CName`-annotated functions.

## Converting from JNI types to Kotlin types

Converting between JNI, Kotlin and back is easy:
```kotlin
```
{src="extensions/converting.kt"}


For a detailed list of functions, see the [API Reference](https://dshatz.github.io/Kotlin-JNI/api/).
